# HIV in South Asia

## Prject Overview
This project explores the relationship between HIV prevalence and socioeconomic indicators across eight **South Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka**. Leveraging public datasets from **WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank**, we structured and analyzed data to understand trends in HIV cases, especially among women and pregnant individuals, while linking them with economic metrics like GDP per capita and unemployment rates.

## SQL Utilization
- Created relational databases and normalized tables to store country-wise HIV and socioeconomic data.
- Wrote complex SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and join datasets for comparative analysis.
- Used table joins to analyze correlations between HIV prevalence and GDP per capita, as well as unemployment rates.
- Implemented calculated fields and conditional logic to derive meaningful insights from raw numeric values.

## Key Finding
- A negative correlation was observed between GDP per capita and HIV prevalence, suggesting better economic conditions are associated with lower HIV incidence.
- The percentage of pregnant women with known HIV status remains inconsistent across countries, pointing to a need for better maternal health screening and support systems.
- These insights emphasize the importance of strengthening healthcare systems, improving HIV awareness and education, and addressing socioeconomic disparities to combat HIV effectively in South Asia.
